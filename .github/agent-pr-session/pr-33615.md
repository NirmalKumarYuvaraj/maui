**Title:** [Android] Title of FlyOutPage is not updating anymore after showing a NonFlyOutPage

**Description:**
Normally when you change the DetailPage of a FlyoutPage, the title (shown in the hamburger menu/toolbar) updates to match the DetailPage's title. After temporarily displaying a non-FlyoutPage by swapping Window.Page and then restoring the FlyoutPage, the title stops updating when navigating between detail pages.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open FlyoutPage with DetailPage1 (title shows "DetailPage1")
2. Navigate to DetailPage2 (title correctly shows "DetailPage2")  
3. Trigger bug: Temporarily replace Window.Page with a non-FlyoutPage
4. Wait 2-3 seconds, then restore the original FlyoutPage
5. Navigate to DetailPage2 - title remains "DetailPage1" (BUG)
6. Navigate back to DetailPage1 - title still stuck on "DetailPage1"
7. Title never updates again regardless of navigation

**External Reproduction:** https://github.com/3sRykaert/MauiMemoryleak/tree/FlyOutPageTitle

- [x] Android (API 30, 34, 36 - verified across versions)

**No PR exists yet** - This is an issue-only investigation

**Key Comments:**
- User @3sRykaert reported issue with detailed reproduction steps
- @LogishaSelvarajSF4525 verified across multiple MAUI versions (10.0.30 back to 9.0.120) and Android APIs (30, 34, 36)
- Issue labeled as verified/triaged

**Edge Cases to Investigate:**
- [ ] Does this affect only Android, or other platforms too?

<summary><strong>🧪 Tests</strong></summary>

**Status**: ▶️ IN PROGRESS (Tests exist, need verification)

- [x] PR includes UI tests (already added in branch)
- [ ] Tests reproduce the issue (needs verification)
- [x] Tests follow naming convention (Issue33615)

**Test Files:**
- HostApp: `src/Controls/tests/TestCases.HostApp/Issues/Issue33615.xaml[.cs]`
- NUnit: `src/Controls/tests/TestCases.Shared.Tests/Tests/Issues/Issue33615.cs`

**Test Category:** UITestCategories.FlyoutPage

**Test Approach:**
- Navigates between DetailPage1 and DetailPage2 (normal behavior)
- Triggers bug by swapping Window.Page to TemporaryPage then back to FlyoutPage
- Attempts navigation after restore - should reproduce stuck title bug
- Note: Test verifies navigation works but title bug is visual (manual verification needed for full confirmation)
